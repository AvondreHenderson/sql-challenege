## Assignment Details
#### It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
#### In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:


#### Data Modeling and Data Engineering
#### Data Analysis

## Using SQL we were tasked with finding the below data analysis
#### 1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
#### 2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
#### 3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
#### 4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
